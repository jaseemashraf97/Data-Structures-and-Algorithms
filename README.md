# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
The problems solved on Data Structures and Algorithms will pushed to this repository on a daily basis.

The focus is mainly on:
  Problem solving and Logical thinking(Brute force)
  Binary search Algorithm
  Greedy Algorithm
  Recursion
  Dynamic Programming
  Graphs and Trees
  Binary Tree
  Linked List
  
  Sub directories were made based on each topics.
  Anyone can find the problem statement and solution in the sub-directories.
